> Manage your personal social data on the web with ease

Many services such as Facebook, Google, Twitter, LinkedIn, etc, do not have a quick way removing apps authenticated by thier OAuth. You have to log onto their website, and revoke permissions for each app. In Facebook, you have to click 5 times before you revoke one app. This will allow you to revoke everything or partial with a single click.

**Install the extension now to take back control of your private data [https://chrome.google.com/webstore/category/extensions](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/category/extensions)**

## Install from Source

```sh
$ bower install && grunt install
```

For now, Facebook Permission Management would be supported. Other Oauth sites will be supported through pull requests or when I get time :)
